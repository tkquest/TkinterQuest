This project has two "tracks":

	-Completion of demo examples of Tkinter features
	-Completion of the actual game which uses Tkinter features

This project has two goals:
	-Produce a fun game using Python Tkinter
	-Create plug-n-play "boilerplate" code for future projects

This git was initially set up, and a workflow moving forward was 
established. It should be trivial to spend 1-2 hours a day putting
time into this project.
